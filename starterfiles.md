#Managed Solution
* Relies on our preferred coding and naming conventions
* Include what we need, but not what we dont
* Relies on techniques we know
* Scalable solution
* Limit repetition (DRY)

* Faster
* Focus on custom work

#The Rules
* Don't go back and update completed projects unless there is budget and time
* Try new techniques when a project specifically calls for it, "new" development
* After every project is complete, revisit Starter Files and incorporate anything new that was learned
* If new ideas occur during a project, but not relavent to current project, note it and use it in the future

#The Prep
* How do you work now? How do you want to work?
* What parts of business/deliverables do you want to support?
* What are your naming conventions?
* How do you want to organize directories and subdirectories?
* What do your team members need and what are they open to?
* What are your patterns in HTML and CSS, even JS?
* What can be shared and what is unique to each type of deliverable?

#Organization & Structure Naming
* Organized by project deliverable
* Needed to identify what assets were for?

#Modularity
* webstandardssherpa.com/reviews/think-modularity
* SASS Placeholders
* Global HTML Modules

#Naming Convetions
* Single class pattern vs multiple class pattern
* Moving away from strictly content-based semantics
* Class name = HTML module file name

* bem.infoi

* smacss.com
* Base, rules, element selectors
* Layout rules, prefixed-classes
* Module rules, block element classes
